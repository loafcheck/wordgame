# FLIP
•  As an English tutor, I needed a tool to input custom vocabulary and create engaging educational games. Since most existing language online games offer preset words, I developed FLIP from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
 <br/>
• Developed a dynamic UI that allows users to input unlimited words and interact with them through flipping cards <br/>
• Integrated a timer using setInterval to monitor game duration<br/>
• Implemented an algorithm to shuffle cards and randomize their grid positions, ensuring a unique layout for each game<br/>
